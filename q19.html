        <b id="2020">2020 Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund fiasco</b>
        <p>In April 2020, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Templeton_Investments">Franklin Templeton</a>
            India unexpectedly wound up six credit funds with assets of close to $4 billion, citing a lack of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_crisis">Liquidity</a> amid the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">Covid-19 Pandemic</a>. These funds had large
            exposure to higher-yielding, lower-rated credit securities. The <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Board_of_India">Securities and Exchange
                Board of India</a> (SEBI) conducted a probe into this sudden closure and found “serious lapses and
            violations”. As a result, in June 2021, SEBI barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund from launching any new
            debt schemes for two years. The regulator also ordered the fund house to refund investment and advisory
            fees, along with interest, of more than 5 billion rupees, and fined the global giant another 50 million
            rupees. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
        <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

        <br>
        <p>
            Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the SEBI’s order and planned to appeal against it. The
            decision to wind up the schemes “was taken with the sole objective of preserving value for unitholders”, a
            spokesperson said. However, the closure of these funds sparked panic withdrawals from other Franklin
            Templeton schemes as well as credit funds of other asset managers, leading to a storm on social media and
            court cases by distraught investors.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

        <b id="relieance">Relieance Mutual Fund</b>
        <p>
            In 2019, the debt schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund faced a liquidity crisis due to their exposure to troubled
            companies like Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL). This led to severe redemptions and forced asset
            sales, which significantly affected investors.

        <b id="il&fs">IL&FS crisis and impact</b>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Leasing_%26_Financial_Services">IL&FS</a> crisis
            in 2018 had a significant impact on the mutual fund industry, including those managed by IDBI Mutual Fund.
            The defaults by IL&FS led to a series of downgrades and defaults on its debt obligations and inter-corporate
            deposits1. This situation caused considerable distress in the financial markets and led to significant
            markdowns in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the affected mutual fund schemes, resulting in losses to
            investors. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>
        <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

            <br>
            The defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity crisis, making it
            difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption demands without selling assets at distressed prices. This
            event heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to widespread downgrades of IL&FS and other non-banking
            financial companies (NBFCs). Consequently, the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these
            securities were adversely affected, reflecting the increased credit risk and decreased market confidence.
            <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

        <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>
            <br>
            Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, particularly those with high exposure to NBFCs and infrastructure
            debt, was severely undermined. This led to significant outflows as investors moved towards safer and more
            liquid investment options. In response, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced
            stricter regulations on sectoral exposure, single issuer limits, and the quality of collateral accepted in
            debt funds to enhance liquidity and reduce risks. Fund managers began focusing on higher-quality assets and
            improved risk management practices. The crisis underscored the need for better credit assessment and
            liquidity management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious investment approach within the mutual
            fund industry.

        <p>
            Several mutual funds, including those managed by JP Morgan Asset Management India, faced significant issues
            due to exposure to Amtek Auto, which defaulted on its debt in 2015. JP Morgan had to suspend redemptions and
            impose exit loads to manage the liquidity crisis.

            In 2018, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund faced redemption pressures in some of its debt schemes due to
            exposure to entities like the Essel Group companies. The Economic Times reported that the Aditya Birla Sun
            Life Mutual Fund was the biggest investor in the Essel Group, with an exposure of Rs 2,936 crore spread
            across 28 schemes1. This accounted for almost 37% of the total debt fund exposure to the Zee group, which is
            part of the Essel Group.

        <b id="dewan">Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis and impact</b>
        <p>The Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis had a profound impact on the Indian mutual fund industry.
            DHFL's defaults created a severe liquidity crunch, making it difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption
            pressures without selling assets at heavily discounted prices. This crisis raised significant concerns about
            the creditworthiness of housing finance companies (HFCs) and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs),
            leading to downgrades of DHFL's debt instruments and adversely affecting the net asset values (NAVs) of
            mutual funds holding these securities.

            <br>
            Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, especially those with high exposure to HFCs and NBFCs, was
            severely shaken, resulting in substantial outflows as investors sought safer investments. In response, the
            Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) increased scrutiny and introduced tighter regulations on
            mutual funds' exposure to individual issuers and sectors to mitigate such risks in the future. Fund managers
            adjusted their portfolios by shifting towards higher-quality and more liquid assets, reducing exposure to
            high-risk debt instruments. The crisis underscored the importance of credit quality and liquidity
            management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious approach within the mutual fund industry

        <b id="2001">2001 UTI Mutual Fund (Unit Trust of India) fiasco</b>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTI_Asset_Management">Unit Trust of India</a> (UTI) faced a
            significant crisis in 2001, which was primarily due to large-scale redemption pressures and mismanagement,
            particularly in its flagship scheme, US-6412. The crisis was exacerbated by the Ketan Parekh scam, which
            caused a sharp decline in stock prices, leading to mutual funds, including UTI’s schemes, suffering severe
            consequences.
            <br>
            The government intervened to protect investors and restructured UTI. This restructuring led to the
            bifurcation of UTI into two separate entities in 2003: the UTI Mutual Fund (now managed by the UTI Trustee
            Company Pvt. Ltd.) and the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), which took over the
            assets and liabilities of the erstwhile UTI12. The government’s intervention included a bailout package to
            stabilize the situation and ensure the protection of investors’ interests.

        <p>
            Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) defaulted on its debt obligations in 2019. This event led
            to significant governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment obligations, prompting
            the Reserve Bank of India to supersede the Board of Directors of DHFL1. The default affected several mutual
            funds, including those managed by BNP Paribas Asset Management India Private Limited, which had to mark down
            the value of their investments in DHFL’s securities.

            <br>
            The crisis deepened with rating downgrades and write-offs by mutual funds, which had a cumulative exposure
            of ₹5,336 crore to securities issued by DHFL3. As a result, there was a severe liquidity issue and a drop in
            the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the mutual funds, impacting investors’ returns. DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund,
            which was a joint venture between DHFL and Pramerica Financial, Inc., also faced challenges due to the
            exposure to DHFL’s debt instruments.

            eventually placed under a moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in March 2020. This led to
            significant challenges for Yes Mutual Fund, particularly its debt schemes that had exposure to Yes Bank’s
            securities. The crisis necessitated write-downs and affected investor confidence. Around 32 mutual fund
            schemes had exposure to Yes Bank’s downgraded debt papers, with a total exposure amounting to approximately
            ₹2,848 crore. The crisis led to write-downs of these securities and impacted the net asset values (NAVs) of
            the mutual funds involved, which in turn affected investor confidence.

        <p>
            In 2019, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotak_Mutual_Fund">Kotak Mutual Fund</a> did face challenges
            with its Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) due to exposure to debt securities of companies like the Essel Group.
            The fund house was unable to redeem investments from these companies, which led to delays and partial
            rollovers of the FMPs. This situation affected the investors’ expected returns. Consequently, the Securities
            and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) barred Kotak from launching new FMPs for six months and imposed a fine
            for failing to abide by regulatory requirements.

        <p>
            HDFC Mutual Fund did face a situation in 2018-2019 due to its exposure to companies like <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essel_Group">Essel Group</a> and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Leasing_%26_Financial_Services">IL&FS</a>. The credit
            events involving these companies led to significant mark-downs in the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Asset_Values">Net Asset Values</a> (NAVs) of some of HDFC Mutual
            Fund’s debt schemes. This situation resulted in investor concerns and redemption pressures.

            <br>
            To elaborate, the IL&FS crisis was one of the biggest financial crises in India, with the company defaulting
            on several of its obligations due to a cash shortfall. The debt involved was about Rs 1 lakh crore.
            Similarly, Essel Group companies were grappling with debt woes, which put mutual funds, including HDFC,
            under redemption pressure. However, HDFC Mutual Fund later recovered the entire investment made in the
            non-convertible debentures issued by Essel Group companies.

        <b id="sahara">Sahara Mutual Fund</b>
        <p>
            SEBI conducted an examination to determine whether Sahara Mutual Fund, its Asset Management Company, and its trustees were ‘fit and proper’ as per regulatory standards. This was in light of a previous SEBI order from 2011 concerning two other Sahara entities, which were directed to refund money collected through Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) to investors. <br>

            In 2015, SEBI ordered the winding up of Sahara Mutual Fund’s schemes due to non-compliance with regulatory requirements. The regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges indeed led to operational difficulties and affected investor confidence in the fund house.
