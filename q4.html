    <h1>History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Early computers</b> were massive machines that marked the beginning of modern computing technology. They were developed during the mid-20th century, primarily for scientific calculations and military use. One of the earliest known computers was the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), built in the United States in 1945. It was huge—occupying an entire room—and used thousands of vacuum tubes to process data. Unlike today’s computers, early machines had no screens, keyboards, or graphical interfaces. Input was given through punched cards or switches, and output was printed on paper. These computers were very slow by today’s standards and could only perform basic arithmetic and logical operations. They were also extremely expensive and required constant maintenance. Another important early computer was the UNIVAC, the first commercial computer made for business and government use. Early computers laid the foundation for all modern technology, and over time, advancements in electronics—like the invention of the transistor and later the microprocessor—led to smaller, faster, and more efficient machines. Despite their limitations, early computers were revolutionary and marked a major turning point in science, communication, and human progress.

        The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b>
        such as the abacus. Later, Charles Babbage proposed the 
        <u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the <strong>first concept 
        of a programmable computer</strong>.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has 
evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors.
The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, 
while the 2nd generation relied on <i>transistors</i>.
By the 4th generation, computers became <em>personal 
and affordable</em>.
<br>
<br>

Computers have developed over five main generations, each marked by major technological advancements. The first generation (1940s–1950s) used vacuum tubes and was large, slow, and expensive. The second generation (1950s–1960s) used transistors, which made computers smaller and more reliable. The third generation (1960s–1970s) introduced integrated circuits, allowing for faster and more efficient machines. The fourth generation (1970s–present) uses microprocessors, which brought personal computers into homes and workplaces. Now, we are in the fifth generation, which focuses on artificial intelligence, advanced computing power, and smart technologies. Each generation has made computers faster, smaller, and more powerful.

    <h2>Mathematics in computing</h2>
    <p>
        Mathematics plays a vital role in computing, as it forms the foundation of how computers work and solve problems. Concepts from mathematics such as algebra, logic, probability, and statistics are used in programming, algorithms, data analysis, and machine learning. Binary number systems, which are based on math, allow computers to process and store data. Mathematical logic is used in decision-making and programming structures like loops and conditions. Algorithms, which are step-by-step procedures to solve problems, are built using mathematical thinking. In areas like graphics, cryptography, and artificial intelligence, advanced math is essential. Overall, mathematics helps computers function accurately, efficiently, and intelligently.
