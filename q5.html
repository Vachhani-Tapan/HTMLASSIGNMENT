<p>
    Masala dosa is a popular South Indian dish known for its crisp, golden-brown exterior and flavorful potato filling. Made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram), the dosa is thin and crepe-like, cooked on a hot griddle until crispy. The spicy mashed potato filling, usually seasoned with mustard seeds, curry leaves, onions, turmeric, and green chilies, is placed inside the dosa before it is folded and served. Masala dosa is typically accompanied by coconut chutney and sambar, a tangy lentil-based vegetable stew. Loved for its taste, texture, and aroma, masala dosa is enjoyed across India and around the world as a hearty breakfast or satisfying meal.

    Paneer Butter Masala is a rich and creamy North Indian dish made with soft paneer (Indian cottage cheese) cooked in a luscious tomato-based gravy. The sauce is typically prepared with butter, fresh cream, tomatoes, onions, and a blend of aromatic spices like garam masala, kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), and chili powder. The paneer absorbs the flavors of the gravy, making each bite smooth, mildly spiced, and full of flavor. Often enjoyed with naan, roti, or jeera rice, Paneer Butter Masala is a popular choice in Indian restaurants and homes alike, loved for its indulgent texture and comforting taste.

<h1 id="gulabjamun">Gulab Jamun</h1>
<p>
    Gulab Jamun is a classic Indian dessert cherished for its soft, melt-in-the-mouth texture and rich, sweet flavor. Made from khoya (reduced milk solids) or milk powder, the dough is shaped into small round balls, deep-fried until golden brown, and then soaked in a warm sugar syrup flavored with cardamom, rose water, or saffron. The name “Gulab Jamun” comes from the Persian words "gulab" (rose) and "jamun" (a type of dark berry), reflecting both its fragrance and appearance. Often served during festivals, weddings, and special occasions, gulab jamun is a beloved treat that offers a perfect balance of richness and sweetness in every bite.
